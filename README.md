# Bug Karplus Portfolio Website

This React portfolio was my first project for a client. Working together through multiple design revisions was a new experience, and increased my ability to make changes on the fly. I'm glad that this was my first professional experience, since the expectations were reasonable and timeline flexible for me, since I'm still learning new things.

## Goals

The goal was to create a minimal website that showcased the artwork and provide contact info for anyone looking to reach out or learn more about the artist. I worked together with the artist through a series of revisions, and I continue to actively update the site.

## Development
This was my first formal React project, and I've really come to like JavaScript.
- CSS grid and flex to present images according to the number of photos.
- React Router for client side navigation across the different pages.
- Designed components that can adjust to any changes in data, be it additional works or additions to the CV.

## Next Steps
With the next update, I want to add a way for the client to be able to add information to the site directly, without my involvement. Doing so is an absolute necessity for other customers going forward.  There are a few ease of use changes I want to add as well, especially a way to switch between works without having to return to the selection page. Finally, I want to integrate a shop page, so people interested in purchasing the art can do so without going to a different site.
